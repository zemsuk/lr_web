        <p>Thurles islamic community centre (hereinafter referred to as TICC') is a non-profit, religious community based in thurles, co. Tipperary. TICC's prayer room is located at 18 parnell st., thurles. TICC's formation came about as the result of a largely expanding islamic community within the town of thurles and surrounding catchment areas. Prior to the formation of TICC, the nearest islamic centre for our members was situated in clonmel, co. Tipperary, some 40 plus kilometres away for most of our members. The strategic plan is the culmination of a collaborative process undertaken by the TICC and the muslim community volunteers for 2019 to 2024. The process aimed to lay store and smooth operation of the TICC for next five years. It has culminated in a series of priorities and goals, as well as financial plan for the TICC, that will define the center's continued success.</p>
